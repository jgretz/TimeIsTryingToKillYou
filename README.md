What is it that makes you unique? What skills, talents, and gifts do you bring every day to your job? Hold them in your mind for a moment. Now answer the question - why do we measure the value of what we do not by the effect it has on the larger world, but by the time you spend typing on a keyboard? What are you actually selling your clients or your company when you are filling out the time detail of your week?

We all have a finite amount of time and can probably agree that it is one of the most precious things we possess. That said, it does not define who we are or what we make, it is simply a tangible aspect of the space in which we work. We lucky few are in the midst of a magical era during which we get to create reality out of imagination, yet we allow ourselves to be judged by the same techniques used to measure the efficiency of manufacturing gun powder and pig iron. To make matters worse, we allow these methods to not only drive us to unhealthy practices, but to define our very self-worth.

This talk is presented by a workaholic, who is slowly recovering and searching for a better way. We will start by looking back at history to see how we got here. Along the way, we will trace how the concept of selling time to measure creative endeavors developed. We will then discuss the effects, both physical and psychological, this practice has on ourselves and our teammates. Finally, we will examine a few new approaches and discuss how they could change the future.

Come to this session to get a new perspective on time itself and the value your work adds to the world.
